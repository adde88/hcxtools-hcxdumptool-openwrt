hcxdumptool + hcxtools for Wifi Pineapple  / OpenWRT
v.6.1.5  

===================================
Both tools are originally created by ZerBea (@github)  
Ported to OpenWRT by: Andreas Nilsen / adde88 (@github) 

This repo. contains both the compiled IPK packages, and the Makefiles needed to compile the projects yourself.  

Feel free to donate if you want to help me out keeping stuff up to date.  
Alot of time and effort goes into keeping everything updated and ported properly. :)
