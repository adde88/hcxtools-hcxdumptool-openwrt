#hcxdumptool + hcxtools 6.1.5 for Wifi Pineapple MK7 
##OpenWRT 19.07 - MIPSEL (ramips/mt7628)  

===================================  
Both tools are originally created by @ZerBea  
Ported to OpenWRT by: Andreas Nilsen / @adde88

This repo. contains both the compiled IPK packages, and the Makefiles needed to compile the projects yourself.  

Feel free to donate if you want to help me out keeping stuff up to date.  
Alot of time and effort goes into keeping everything updated and ported properly. :)
